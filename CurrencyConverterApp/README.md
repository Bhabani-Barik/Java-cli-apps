## Java Project :: Currency Converter

This project converts amounts between different currencies based on user input. Users provide the amount and the desired currencies for conversion, and the program calculates the result based on current exchange rates.

Here are two different solutions for the Currency Converter project in Java :
    1. Using If-Else Statements:
        Input: User enters an amount, a source currency, and a target currency.
        If-Else Structure: The conversion rate is chosen using a series of if-else statements based on the currency pair.
        Conversion: The amount is multiplied by the conversion rate to calculate the final converted amount.
        Invalid Input Handling: If an invalid currency combination is provided, an error message is displayed.
        Result: The result is printed as the converted amount in the target currency.

    2.  Using Switch-Case Statements:
        Input: User inputs an amount, a source currency, and a target currency.
        Switch-Case Structure: The switch-case block is used to select the conversion rate based on currency pairs.
        Conversion: The input amount is multiplied by the conversion rate to calculate the result.
        Error Handling: If an invalid currency is entered, an error message is displayed.
        Result: The converted amount is printed based on the selected currencies.
