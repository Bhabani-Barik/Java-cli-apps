## Java Project - Unit Conversion:

A tool that allows users to convert between different units such as length (meters to miles), temperature (Celsius to Fahrenheit), or weight (kilograms to pounds). The user inputs the value and selects the units for conversion.

Here are two different solutions for the Unit Converter project in Java, focusing on converting between units of length, temperature, and weight:

1. Using If-Else Statements: 
Input: The user inputs a value, a unit type (length, temperature, or weight), and the unit to convert from and to.
If-Else Structure: Conversions are handled by checking the unit type, and corresponding from-to conversions are implemented.
Conversion: Specific conversion formulas are applied based on the unit type and units.
Invalid Inputs: If an invalid conversion is entered, the program outputs an error message.
Result: The program outputs the converted value in the desired unit.
